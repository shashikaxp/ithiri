# ithiri

Ithiri is an application which dynamically generates weekly shopping lists. This application has been developed based on weekly discounted items offered by two main supermarket chains in Australia, namely Woolworths and Coles.

The discounted price offered by supermarkets will be displayed under each product and users add these items into their weekly grocery list. Ithiri will generates few shopping lists options, based on the time and money saving. Ultimately, users can send these shopping list options to their emails and have a better shopping experience.
